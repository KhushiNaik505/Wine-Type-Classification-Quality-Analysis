## 🍷 Wine Type Classification & Quality Analysis using Python

This project explores the chemistry behind wine quality using Python and Pandas in a Google Colab environment. Leveraging a dataset of 6,497 wine samples, the analysis focuses on distinguishing red and white wines while uncovering the chemical factors that influence quality ratings.

The workflow includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on 12 key chemical attributes such as alcohol content, pH, volatile acidity, and residual sugar. Through statistical summaries and feature distribution analysis, the project identifies meaningful chemical profiles associated with high-quality wines.

# 🔍 Key Highlights:

Comprehensive EDA on large-scale wine data

Statistical comparison of red vs. white wine characteristics

Insights into chemical features impacting wine quality

Clean, reproducible analysis using Pandas and Python

This project demonstrates practical data analysis skills and showcases how data-driven insights can be used to understand real-world quality assessment problems.
